# Frontend-applications
For this course I will learn how to create visualisations from external data. This data will then be visualized in D3. The website will be made with React.

## Design Challenge
**Subject: The car in the city**

How do different municipalities and places deal with parking within the city?

We are going to deliver an interactive data visualization. We must have a good title with a good description. Building is done with a front-end framework.

## Concept

**Is there a connection between the number of parking spots and province?**

### Assumptions
I assume that Noord-Holland will be having the highest average parking spots since Amsterdam has the most population dense city of the Netherlands.

## Data I need

[I will be needing the unique identifier of the garages](https://npropendata.rdw.nl/parkingdata/v2/)

I will also need the parking garage data. This data has been downloaded locally. Shoutout to Sam for providing me this!
